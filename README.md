At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in The Marvel's Movie would be the beginning of “a new era” for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did hemean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU's roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam and so on. As The Marvel's Movie neared theaters, though, Johnsonclarified that statement in are cent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (watch above).

That's why you see in The Exorcist: Believer Movie, we acknowledge everyone: Batman , Superman , Wonder Woman, Flash, we acknowledge everybody. There's also some Easter eggs in there, too.

It's no less numbing to find material meant for children retconned for adultsand, in the process,for most of the naïve delight to be leached out, and for any serious concerns to be shoehornedin and then waved away with dazzle and noise. The Marvel's Movie” offers a mor alrealm that draws no lines, a personal one of simplistic stakes, a political one that suggests anyinte rpretation, an audiovisual one that rehashes long-familiar tropesand repackages overus eddevices for a commercial experiment that might as well wear its import as its title.

“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” has caught some fire at the domestic box office. Lionsgate’s “Hunger Games” prequel earned about $19.1 million on its opening day from 3,776 locations, a figure that includes $5.75 million in Thursday previews.

The new installment in the young adult dystopian action series will still secure the top slot at the domestic box office over a busy weekend, which also sees the wide releases of the animated sequel “Trolls Band Together” and the seasonal slasher “Thanksgiving.”

“Songbirds and Snakes” has a leg up with increased ticket prices from Imax and other premium large formats. It’s looking at a three-day tally of about $45 million, which would mark an okay debut for a franchise revival with a $100 million production budget. That’s still trending behind projections of $50 million heading into the weekend. It also has little hope of reaching the box office heights of previous “Hunger Games” entries. The 2012 original notched a March opening weekend record at the time with a staggering $152 million. “Catching Fire” followed with $158 million before the two-part “Mockingjay” finale sloped down with $121 million and $102 million.

“After decades of unwavering fan loyalty, the superhero genre seems tobe at a crossroads and a reassessment of what will drive audiences to the multiplex is in order,” Paul Dergarabedian adds. “Marvel is a massive brand that remains appealing to audiences around theworld, but new strategies mayhave to be instituted to ensure future success.”
